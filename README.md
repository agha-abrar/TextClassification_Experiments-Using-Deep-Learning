**About This Project**

This project focuses on text classification using advanced deep learning techniques. It implements various text encoding and embedding methods to train and evaluate models on a labeled dataset. The project is designed to explore and compare different strategies for effective text classification.

**Key Features**

Text Preprocessing: Removes stop-words, punctuation, and performs tokenization to prepare clean input data.
Encoding Techniques:
Single-Gram Multi-Hot Encoding
Two-Gram Multi-Hot Encoding
Two-Gram TF-IDF Encoding
Embedding Methods:
Learned embeddings using an embedding layer with LSTM.
Pretrained GloVe embeddings integrated with LSTM.
Pretrained FastText embeddings integrated with LSTM.
Model Architectures:
Fully connected networks for encoding-based techniques.
LSTM-based models for embedding-driven approaches.

**How It Works**

The models are trained on a labeled dataset split into training and testing subsets. A portion of the training data is used for validation during training to monitor performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated on the test set to evaluate and compare the models. Training and evaluation are performed using TensorFlow/Keras, ensuring scalability and efficiency.

**Technologies Used**

Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Text Processing Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn
Pretrained Embeddings: GloVe, FastText
